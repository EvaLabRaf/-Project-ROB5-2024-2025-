# Project-ROBO5  
**Mapping and Navigation on Turtlebot3**  

## Overview  
This project focuses on implementing mapping and navigation functionalities on the Turtlebot3 using ROS1 Noetic. By using the robot's sensors and ROS tools, we explored real-time motion control, data processing, and navigation in dynamic environments.

## Repository Structure  

### Files Included in the Repository 
- **`Kalman_all.m`**: MATLAB script used for processing sensor data (IMU and Odometry) with a Kalman filter.  
- **`catkin_ws_computer.zip`**: A zipped Catkin workspace containing ROS1 packages and configurations used for the project. Extract this folder to work with the ROS environment.  
- **`command_turtle.txt`**: This file was used as a reference for frequently run commands like starting nodes, controlling the Turtlebot, and managing the ROS environment. 
- **`simulation.m`**: MATLAB script for running simulations based on Turtlebot3 sensor data gathered with "Kalman_all.m".
